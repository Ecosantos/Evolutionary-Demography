Some scripts used in my PhD

I'm a PhD student of Evolutionary ecology in The Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ) under Maja Kajin supervision.

My PhD focus in evolutionary trade-off between survival and fecundity using animal (and why not plants too?) Leslie matrices avaliable in literature.

I often use the Popbio package to perform my analysis, however, sometimes I need to adapt some functions to deal with some problems. These new codes will be provide here as soon as possible. 

I started to use R a few years ago, but just using extensively for my Master researches when I did some scripts that I love sharing with other people.

I belief in the Open Science phylosophy and think that is the way to do good science. I hope to contribute to you with the scripts of my projects.

If you have some contribution, let's talk about and If you need some help be free to email me: ssantos.gabriel@gmail.com
