# Evolutionary-Demography
Some scripts used to my PhD

I'm PhD student of Evolutionary ecology in University of State of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) under supervision of Maja Kajin

My PhD focus in evolutionary trade-off between survival and fecundity using animal (and why not plants too?) population matrices avaliable in literature.
I often use popbio package, but sometimes is really necessary to adapt some functions to deal with some problems.

I started to use R a few years ago, but just using extensively for my Master researches when I did some scripts that I love sharing with other people.

I belief in the Open Science and think that is the way to do good science. I hope to contribute to you with my past projects and actual projects.

If you have some contribution, let's talk about and If you need some help be free to email me: ssantos.gabriel@gmail.com
