# Evolutionary-Demography
Some scripts used to my PhD

I'm PhD student of Evolutionary ecology in University of state of Rio de Janeiro under supervision of Maja Kajin

My PhD focus in evolutionary trade-off between survival and fecundity using population matrices avaliable in literature.
This reason I use popbio package all the time but sometimes is necessary adapt the functions available to my questions.

I start use R few years ago, using extensively for my Master researches and did some scripts that I love sharing with other people.

I belive in open science and think that is the way to do good science. I hope contribute to you with my past projects and actual projects.

If you have some contribution, wanna talk about R ideas or need help send an email: ssantos.gabriel@gmail.com
